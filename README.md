Use ctrl+shfit+F5 to reload package in Atom (sometimes need to press twice)

progress:
- can read and evaluate basic functions from current file window (i.e., addition.js)
- open workspace panel as an editable window for user inputs
- reevaluates code on code (onDidChange)

TODOS (sorted by difficulty):
- better UI/layout for example panel
- reevaluate code on example change
- multiple input/output examples for single function
- save examples in a temp file (associated with code file) and load when we pull up that code file
- provide examples for multiple functions
- only rerun/update output examples on syntactically correct code (for .js is the same as running the code?)


Long term TODOS:
- support Haskell
- synthesize code
