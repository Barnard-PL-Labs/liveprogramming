progress:
- can read and evaluate basic functions from current file window (i.e., addition.js)

next step:
- open workspace panel as an editable window for user inputs
  -  workspace.buildTextEditor seems like a good lead
  - also look into opening without specifying a URI
- figure out how to update the window live (keyboard mapping?)
